### Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi, I’m Vishwajeet, a developer who enjoys building practical tools and apps with code. My GitHub is home to projects where I experiment with **React, Next.js, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Neon Postgres, and the Deepseek API**. I love creating solutions that are useful and user-friendly, often inspired by everyday challenges. Take a look around my repos to see what I’ve been working on! 😊

### 🌟 About Me

- **Code Enthusiast:** I thrive on turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications.
- **Tech Explorer:** From front-end magic with React to backend wizardry with Python, I love mixing and matching technologies.
- **Problem Solver:** My projects aim to make life easier, whether it’s planning travel itineraries or analyzing data with AI.
- **Fun Fact:** When I’m not coding, you might find me dreaming up my next pet project or sipping chai while debugging.


### 💻 Tech Stack
Here’s the toolbox I wield to bring ideas to life:

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Node.js, Neon Postgres
- **APIs & AI:** Deepseek API, public APIs (weather, stocks, etc.)
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, VS Code, and a sprinkle of creativity

### 🚧 What’s Next?
I’m always tinkering with new ideas! Some upcoming projects include:

- A real-time dashboard for personal finance using Next.js and public stock APIs.
- An AI-powered learning assistant with Python and Deepseek API to make studying more engaging.
- A fun side project to gamify productivity (because who doesn’t love a little motivation?).
