### Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi, I’m Vishwajeet Kondi, a developer who enjoys building practical tools and apps with code. My GitHub is home to projects where I experiment with **React, Next.js, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Neon Postgres, and the Deepseek API**. I love creating solutions that are useful and user-friendly, often inspired by everyday challenges. Take a look around my repos to see what I’ve been working on! 😊

### 🚧 What’s Next?
I’m always experimenting with fresh ideas and striving to expand my skill set. Here’s a peek at what’s on the horizon:

- Developing a **real-time personal finance dashboard** with Next.js and public stock APIs, or crafting an **AI-powered learning assistant** using Python and the Deepseek API.
- Deepening my knowledge of **iOS Native (SwiftUI)**—excited to apply these skills and launch a practical iOS app soon.
- Working on a side project to gamify productivity—because a little extra motivation makes progress even more rewarding!

### 🤝 Let’s Connect & Collaborate!
