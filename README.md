### Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

Hi, I’m Vishwajeet, a developer who enjoys building practical tools and apps with code. My GitHub is home to projects where I experiment with **React, Next.js, Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Neon Postgres, and the Deepseek API**. I love creating solutions that are useful and user-friendly, often inspired by everyday challenges. Take a look around my repos to see what I’ve been working on! 😊

### 🌟 About Me

- **Code Enthusiast:** I thrive on turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications.
- **Tech Explorer:** From front-end magic with React to backend wizardry with Python, I love mixing and matching technologies.
- **Problem Solver:** My projects aim to make life easier, whether it’s planning travel itineraries or analyzing data with AI.
- **Fun Fact:** When I’m not coding, you might find me dreaming up my next pet project or sipping chai while debugging.


### 🚧 What’s Next?
I’m always experimenting with fresh ideas and striving to expand my skill set. Here’s a peek at what’s on the horizon:

- Developing a **real-time personal finance dashboard** with Next.js and public stock APIs, or crafting an **AI-powered learning assistant** using Python and the Deepseek API.
- Deepening my knowledge of **iOS Native (SwiftUI)**—excited to apply these skills and launch a practical iOS app soon.
- Working on a side project to gamify productivity—because a little extra motivation makes progress even more rewarding!
